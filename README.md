The aim of this project will be to use our skills of linear regression to find certain effects on traveling patterns for the summer of 2021. 
The data folder has all the raw data files that we used for this project. 
Our notebooks are where we did the interium data analysis on the various variables that we wanted to pull in for our models. 
Any code books that are relevant were stored in the references folder.
Our final report is in the reports folder in PDF format.
And any remaining source code we used is in the src folder.
